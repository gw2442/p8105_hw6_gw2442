The CSV file was downloaded from the GitHub repository, imported, and
cleaned. The dataset `homicide_data` has 52,179 rows and 12 columns. The
dataset contains information on the homicide ID number, reported date,
the victim’s first and last name, race, age, sex, location of homicide
(including city, state, longtidue, and latitude), and disposition of the
case. While there are 0 missing variables for variables `uid`,
`victim_last`, `victim_first`, `victim_race`, `victim_age`,
`victim_sex`, `city`, `state`, `disposition`, and `reported date`, there
are 60 missing variables for `lat` and `lon`.

#### Creating variable `city_state`:

``` r
homicide_data =
  homicide_data %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = as.character(paste(city, state, sep = "_")))
```

#### Creating variable `unsolved_homicide` and tidying data:

The variable `solved_homicide` was created. Those with the disposition
“Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest” were categorised as an
unsolved homicide and were therefore given a value of 0 in the variable
`solved_homicide`. Those with the disposition “Closed by arrest” were
categorised as a solved homicide and were therefore given a value of 1
in the variable `solved_homicide`.

The cities Dallas, Phoenix, Kansas City, and Tulsa were omitted from the
dataset, as well as any race entries other than White or Black and any
victim age’s that were non-numeric.

``` r
homicide_data = 
  homicide_data %>%
  mutate(solved_homicide = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0)) %>%
  filter(city != "Dallas", 
         city != "Phoenix", 
         city != "Kansas City", 
         city != "Tulsa") %>%
  filter(victim_race == "White" | victim_race == "Black") %>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>%
  drop_na(victim_age)
```
